She first started to draft her novels in 1795, but they got published only several years later.</p>\n<p>After living in Bath for a while, she moved to Chawton (not far from Steventon), this marked her most fruitful period as a writer.<br>\nIn 1811 she published anonymously (&quot;by a lady&quot;) <em>Sense and sensibility</em> and was well received by the critics, but her most famous book is <em><strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong></em>.</p>\n<h2 id="style">Style</h2>\n<p>Jane Austen sets all her novels in the <strong>provincial southern England</strong> where she lived, the characters generally belong to the rural middle class, the landed gentry and the clergy.<br>\nThey are <strong>very precisely described</strong> in particular we are given a very clear view of their place in society.<br>\nAusten\'s skill as a writer is shown by the <strong>psychological insights</strong> and the lively <strong>round characters</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Her novels are quiet</strong>, the characters well mannered, the only exciting element is love, not passionate or tragic love, but a <strong>polite love</strong>.<br>\nAustens satirizes the <strong>exaggerated sentimentality of contemporary novels</strong>, and rejects a purely romantic and sentimental view of love.</p>\n<p>The <strong>witty and ironical dialogues</strong> render common characters interesting. Austen doesn\'t present heroes, but smiles at human frailties.</p>\n<p>The didactic aim of her novels and the use of irony detach her from the romantic genre of the time.</p>\n<h2 id="pride-and-prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</h2>\n<p>Set in the countryside of southern England <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is centered on <strong>love and marriage</strong>.<br>\nThe plot revolves aroung Elizabeth Bennet, at first she gets courted by Bingley and is herself attracted by him, but in the end she realizes that her prejudice against Darcy was wrong and marries him.</p>\n<p>In this novel Austen satirizes <strong>the desperate search for a husband</strong>.</p>\n<h1 id="mary-shelly">Mary Shelly</h1>\n<h2 id="biography-2">Biography</h2>\n<p>Mary Shelly was brought up among ideals of concern for her fellow beings. She fell in <strong>love with Percy Bysshe Shelly</strong>, with whom she <strong>traveled across Europe</strong>, until they settled in <strong>Geneva</strong>, where Lord Byron joined them.</p>\n<p>She started writing <em>Frankenstein</em> as a challenge posed by Byron and published it in 1818.<br>\nShe wrote 5 more novels, the best of which is <em>The Last Man</em>.</p>\n<h2 id="frankenstein-or-the-modern-prometheus">Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus</h2>\n<h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>\n<p>In this novel Shelly modernizes the ancient dream of the <strong>creation of artificial life</strong>. It could be defined both a philosophical romance and a Gothic tale.</p>\n<p>She merges the Romantics\' interest in the <strong>effects of science on man</strong> and the macabre of the <strong>Gothic tales</strong>. She takes the emotional language and the atmosphere of <strong>suspence</strong> from the Gothic novels, but <strong>substitutes the supernatural with science</strong>.<br>\nFor treating the theme of scientific research and its philosophical implications, <em>Frankenstein</em> is considered the forerunner of science fiction.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Frankestein\'s character was inspired by Faust</strong>: he wants to have a God-like power, he wants to create life.<br>\nOn the other hand <strong>Frankenstein\'s monster</strong> is a Romantic dark hero: outcast of society, suffering for no fault of his own.</p>\n<h3 id="style-2">Style</h3>\n<p>Frankenstein is told in <strong>first person</strong> by 3 non-omniscent narrators: Robert Walton (an explorer), Dr. Frankenstein and the monster.<br>\nThe novel starts with a letter from Walton to his sister, then there is the <strong>autobiography of Dr. Frankenstein</strong> and <strong>a report by the monster</strong> and finally it concludes with another letter from Walton.</p>\n<h1 id="the-victorian-age">The Victorian Age</h1>\n<h2 id="historical-setting">Historical setting</h2>\n<h3 id="an-age-of-industry-and-reform">An age of industry and reform</h3>\n<p>When Queen Victoria (1837-1901) came to the throne, <strong>the poor still endured apalling conditions</strong>, aggravated by a crisis of industry and agriculture.<br>\nIn 1867 a Reform Bill <strong>granted town workers the right to vote</strong>, but not miners and agricultural workers, in 1884 the suffrage was extended to all male workers.</p>\n<p>England adopted <strong>free trade</strong> and in 1851 in London a <strong>Great International Exhibition</strong> was held.<br>\nThe industrial development was fast: <strong>railways</strong> quickly covered much of the country and <strong>steamboat</strong> services connected England to the rest of the world. The telegraph was invented and London was the first city to have <strong>gas lighting</strong>.</p>\n<p>With the <strong>Poor Law</strong> of 1834 poor were amassed in <strong>workhouses</strong> that closely resembled jails. In large cities <strong>urban slums</strong> developed.</p>\n<p>Various social reforms were passed: women and children employment in mines was forbidden, <strong>unions were legalized</strong> and catholics were accepted in the government.<br>\nDuring this period the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Labour Party were born.</p>\n<h3 id="the-british-empire">The British Empire</h3>\n<h4 id="the-irish-question">The Irish question</h4>\n<p>Due to various <strong>famines</strong>, the potato blight of 1845 in particular, many Irish people were left with <strong>emigration</strong> as their only alternative to starvation.<br>\nA movement for Irish independece tried presented the <strong>Irish Home Rule Bill</strong>, but it was rejected. The home rule is self=government.</p>\n<h4 id="foreign-policy">Foreign policy</h4>\n<p>Britain set herself at the head of <strong>liberal forces in Europe</strong>. In the <strong>Crimean War</strong> Britain sided with Turkey and defeated Russia.</p>\n<p>During Victoria\'s reign <strong>the British Empire greatly expanded</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Australia and New Zeland became important centres for cattle</li>\n<li>Britain started to rulee directly over India</li>\n<li>the Suez Canal was realized</li>\n<li>Britain won the <strong>Boer War</strong>, gaining territories rich in gold and diamonds</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="the-american-frontier-and-the-civil-war">The American Frontier and the Civil War</h3>\n<h4 id="the-growth-of-the-usa-and-the-gold-rush">The Growth of the USA and the Gold Rush</h4>\n<p>Thanks to the <strong>millions of immigrants</strong> the economy of the US grew enormously. Most of those workers settled in new territories in the West, expanding the so called <strong>Frontier</strong>.<br>\nAfter gold was discovered in California many people from all over the world came to look for it, this was the <strong>Gold Rush</strong>.<br>\nThe South was mainly agricultural, while the North had industries and a flourishing shipping trade.</p>\n<h4 id="the-civil-war-1861-65">The Civil War (1861-65)</h4>\n<p><strong>The conflict arouse due to slavery</strong>, practiced in the South, while opposed in the North, but it was also a conflict of different economies.<br>\n<strong>The North won</strong> and slavery was abolished.</p>\n<p>The USA recovered well from the civil war and their production began to outclass even Britain\'s.</p>\n<h2 id="the-victorian-compromise">The Victorian compromise</h2>\n<h3 id="respectability-and-hypocrisy">Respectability and hypocrisy</h3>\n<p><em>Victorian</em> is now associated with <em><strong>prudery</strong></em>, altough this is not false, it\'s also true that many of the most unpleasant aspects were inherited from previous times.<br>\nThe Victorian establishment tried to <strong>cover the unpleasant aspects of life</strong> with a veil of respectability and optimism.</p>\n<p>The <strong>outward strictness</strong> of Victorian morals was <strong>incoherent</strong> with the private life that the upper and middle class led. For example indirectly pushing thousands of women into prostitution.<br>\nThis hypocrisy eventually led to the collapse of the Victorian standards.</p>\n<h3 id="concerns-for-the-poor-and-the-environment">Concerns for the poor and the environment</h3>\n<p>The reaction to liberalism and industrialism was strong, many feared that Britain would split into &quot;two nations&quot;: <strong>the poor and the rich</strong>. The miserable conditions of the working class inspired Marx and Engels their communist theories.<br>\nThe were also concerns for the <strong>damage to the environment</strong></p>\n<h2 id="the-victorian-novel">The Victorian novel</h2>\n<h3 id="early-victorian-novel">Early Victorian novel</h3>\n<p>For the firt time in history the novel became the <strong>leading genre</strong>, because it reflected the practical bent of the times, the scientific innovation and the economic developments.</p>\n<p>Victorian readers expected to be <strong>instructed and entertained</strong> at the same time. At the same time the writers <strong>avoided themes that could cause shock</strong> conforming to the moral standards.</p>\n<p>The most renowned novelist of the age was <strong>Charles Dickens</strong>. He shows his consciousness for themes like social injustice, poverty and corruption. He uses the <strong>comical</strong> to highlight those issues, however he <strong>doesn\'t question the roots of society</strong> and instead divides characters into good and bad people.</p>\n<p>Emily Bronte wrote <strong>Wuthering Heights</strong>, the archetype of the novel of Romantic love: the hero, Heathcliff, is a <strong>Romantic dark hero</strong> consumed by his love for Catherine. Tha latter although loving him marries another man to <strong>follow social conventions</strong>, their ghost continue to love each other after death.<br>\nIn the ending we see the influence of Romantic and <strong>Gothic themes</strong>.</p>\n<p>In Charlotte Bronte\'s <em>Jane Eyre</em> we find a mix of realism and imagination.</p>\n<p>The general tendency of the age is that of a <strong>mild realism</strong>, the caracters tend to be acceptable by everyone, the public relates with them through <strong>comedy</strong> or the <strong>drama of passion</strong>.<br>\nThe narrator is usually omniscent, with <em>Wuthering Heights</em>\' 3 narrators being the great exception.</p>\n<h3 id="late-victorian-novel">Late Victorian novel</h3>\n<p>In the late Victorian Age <em><strong>Realism</strong></em> develops, this literary movements intends to <strong>capture reality</strong> in the most <strong>precise and unjudging</strong> way possible.<br>\nIt dealt with the influence of the social environment on man and the complex workings of the mind and the conscience.<br>\nIts <strong>predilection for poor social settings</strong> was a reaction against the Victorian ideology.</p>\n<h4 id="stevenson">Stevenson</h4>\n<p>Stevenson\'s masterpiece <em><strong>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</strong></em> on a superficial level is a horror story, but on a deeper level the book <strong>poses serious questions about human nature</strong> and states that science cannot hope to divided the inherently bad part of mankind from the good, thus <strong>striking at the core of the Victorian compromise</strong>.</p>\n<h4 id="hardy">Hardy</h4>\n<p>Thomas Hardy called his works &quot;Novels of Character and Environment&quot;, the 2 elements that, he thought, shape a man\'s destiny. He was inspired by Schopenhauer\'s <em>Immanent Will</em>.</p>\n<h4 id="wilde-and-aestheticism">Wilde and Aestheticism</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Aesthetic Movement</strong> beliefs are summed up in the slogan <em><strong>Art for Art\'s sake</strong></em>, ths implied a total detachment from sociall and moral issues.<br>\nThe most important writer of this stream is <strong>Oscar Wilde</strong>, he only wrote one novel: <em><strong>The Picture of Dorian Gray</strong></em>, but it was immensely successful.<br>\nThe main characters is Dorian Gray, a man who stays forever young, while his portrait ages.<br>\nThe philosophy of the book is the cult of the beautiful things and the indifference to social issues.</p>\n<h4 id="colonial-novels">Colonial novels</h4>\n<p>With the expansion of the British Empire novels started to talk about this territories.<br>\n<strong>Richard Kipling</strong> was the first major  writer to explore the relationship between the British and the Indians, but he never questions the right of the British to be in India, he thinks that they are there to take up <em><strong>the white man\'s burden</strong></em>.</p>\n',frontmatter:{title:"From Austen to the Victorian Age",pdfCompletoPath:null,draft:!1},headings:[{value:"<p>Jane Austen</p>\n",depth:1,rawText:"Jane Austen"},{value:"<p>Biography</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"Biography"},{value:"<p>Style</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"Style"},{value:"<p>Pride and Prejudice</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"Pride and Prejudice"},{value:"<p>Mary Shelly</p>\n",depth:1,rawText:"Mary Shelly"},{value:"<p>Biography</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"Biography"},{value:"<p>Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus"},{value:"<p>Themes</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"Themes"},{value:"<p>Style</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"Style"},{value:"<p>The Victorian Age</p>\n",depth:1,rawText:"The Victorian Age"},{value:"<p>Historical setting</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"Historical setting"},{value:"<p>An age of industry and reform</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"An age of industry and reform"},{value:"<p>The British Empire</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"The British Empire"},{value:"<p>The Irish question</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"The Irish question"},{value:"<p>Foreign policy</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"Foreign policy"},{value:"<p>The American Frontier and the Civil War</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"The American Frontier and the Civil War"},{value:"<p>The Growth of the USA and the Gold Rush</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"The Growth of the USA and the Gold Rush"},{value:"<p>The Civil War (1861-65)</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"The Civil War (1861-65)"},{value:"<p>The Victorian compromise</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"The Victorian compromise"},{value:"<p>Respectability and hypocrisy</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"Respectability and hypocrisy"},{value:"<p>Concerns for the poor and the environment</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"Concerns for the poor and the environment"},{value:"<p>The Victorian novel</p>\n",depth:2,rawText:"The Victorian novel"},{value:"<p>Early Victorian novel</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"Early Victorian novel"},{value:"<p>Late Victorian novel</p>\n",depth:3,rawText:"Late Victorian novel"},{value:"<p>Stevenson</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"Stevenson"},{value:"<p>Hardy</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"Hardy"},{value:"<p>Wilde and Aestheticism</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"Wilde and Aestheticism"},{value:"<p>Colonial novels</p>\n",depth:4,rawText:"Colonial novels"}]}},pathContext:{category:"English literature",title:"From Austen to the Victorian Age"}}}});
